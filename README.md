# OOPs Project Collection

This repository contains multiple projects built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in Python. Each project demonstrates key OOP principles such as **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction** through real-world applications.

## Projects Included

### 1. Online Course Management System
A system that allows students to enroll in courses, track progress, and manage assignments.
- Implements **encapsulation** for user data security.
- Uses **polymorphism** to handle different types of users (students, instructors, admins).
- **Abstraction** is applied for course content management.

### 2. Travel Planner & Cost Calculator
A travel assistant that helps users plan trips and estimate travel expenses.
- Utilizes **inheritance** for different travel modes (flights, trains, buses, etc.).
- Implements **encapsulation** to store user preferences securely.
- Uses **abstraction** to simplify trip planning.

### 3. Mini Superhero Project (Inheritance Demo)
A fun project that creates different superheroes with unique abilities and power levels.
- **Inheritance** is used to define various superhero classes from a base character class.
- **Polymorphism** allows different superheroes to have unique powers and attacks.
- **Encapsulation** ensures private attributes like hero identity remain secure.

### 4. Animal Inheritance Class
A project demonstrating class inheritance in an animal kingdom simulation.
- **Inheritance** is used to categorize animals into different species.
- **Polymorphism** allows for unique behaviors among different animal types.
- **Encapsulation** ensures that animal attributes remain protected.

### 5. User Login System
A secure login system with user authentication and role-based access control.
- **Encapsulation** ensures sensitive user data is stored securely.
- **Abstraction** is used to handle login and authentication processes.
- **Polymorphism** allows different types of users (admin, guest, registered user) to have unique access levels.

### 6. Turtle Module Project
A graphical project using Pythonâ€™s Turtle module for drawing and visualization.
- Uses **OOP principles** to create reusable drawing functions.
- Implements **encapsulation** to manage Turtle objects efficiently.
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** through different drawing patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Primary language)
- **OOP Principles** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOPs_Project.git
   cd OOPs_Project
   ```
2. Run the individual project scripts:
   ```sh
   python online_course.py
   python travel_planner.py
   python superhero.py
   python animal_inheritance.py
   python user_login.py(class.py)
   python turtle_project.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add a GUI for better user interaction.
- Implement a database for persistent storage.
- Improve travel cost estimation using real-time data.
